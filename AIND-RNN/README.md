# Recurrent Neural Networks: time series prediction and text generation

#### Step 1: Implement a function to window time series

#### Step 2: Create a simple RNN model using keras to perform regression
Build an RNN model to perform regression. RNN model in keras with LSTM module of dimension defined in the notebook. 

#### Step 3: Clean up a large text corpus
Find and remove all non-english or punctuation characters from input text data.

#### Step 4: Implement a function to window a large text corpus
Implement a function to window input text data.

#### Step 5: Create a simple RNN model using keras to perform multiclass classification
Build an RNN model to perform multiclass classification. RNN model in keras with LSTM module of dimension defined in the notebook.

#### Step 6: Generate text using a fully trained RNN model and a variety of input sequences
Generate text using a trained RNN classifier.  To generated text from a trained RNN module.
